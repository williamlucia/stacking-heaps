Hi :wave:,

Welcome to *Stacking Heaps*, my personal blog.

I am William, an Italian guy fascinated by Computer Science. 
My main expertise is around data engineering at scale, so this blog will be pretty technical :nerd:

I am also in love with algorithms and data structures so some content will touch those topics as well.

Hope you will enjoy reading my contents. Please feel free to suggest improvements, corrections or any new content that you would like to be covered! :technologist:
